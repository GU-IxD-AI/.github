## Interaction Design and AI Research on COmputational Creativity ðŸ‘‹

The organisation aims to provide access to tutorials, howtos and support when engaging with computational creativity tools and approaches either from an Arts or Technical perspective. It was initiated by a Vinnova project between Swen Gaudl and Amy Hoover to explore generative ai approaches for responsible engagement with sound generation. The organisation is providing its resources free and aims to be a hub for sharing information.

If you want to contribute, feel free to get in touch as we are looking to expand the community in both research and practice and aim for creating a network of people that actively and positively want to contribute to a better and responsible use of technology in the creative domains.

A first starting point is our research project [Sounds of Intelligence](https://ljudavint.fairrats.eu) which should give a good idea about the direction and you can also see who initiated the organisation.
